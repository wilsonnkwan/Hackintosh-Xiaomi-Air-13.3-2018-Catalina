Hackintosh - Catalina for Xiaomi Notebook Air 13.3 (2018)

I directly copied from Johnnync13's repo, please give him credit.

The EFI will work for Catalina, however, do note that Catalina do not have drivers for USB Wifi or USB LAN, so my suggestion to you is to get a USB Wifi that is in the Chris1111's https://github.com/chris1111/Wireless-USB-Adapter-Clover
